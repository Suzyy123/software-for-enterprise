This project demonstrates the event-driven programming concept using a basic web page constructed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The page allows the user to type text into an input field and click on a submit button, which triggers a JavaScript function that outputs the typed text.
This interaction demonstrates how the program responds to user input, in this scenario, clicking buttons. In addition, there is also support for dynamically 
adding new buttons, again demonstrating how several user actions can affect changes on the page. The project demonstrates the most basic principle of event-driven
programming responding to events like user input to make web applications interactive.
